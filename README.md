## No longer working after a Discord update that changed the file structure and code enough for glasscord to break (Glasscord has also been discontinued by the creator)
# Description
This is a basic installer made in C++ for Powercord themes that use Glasscord. Feel free tu report any issues you encounter.  
For some reason this can get flagged by some antimalware software so I would recommend you add an exception to the .exe or compile it from source if you don't trust the binaries in releases  
**Note:** In releases you can find two versions: .sfx.exe (packaged .exe that lets you choose extraction location and auto-creates a desktop shortcut for the program) and .exe which is the standalone program binaries.  
# Requirements
* Discord Canary (Windows only)
* Powercord

# Installation Steps for the Installer
Installation steps for the .sfx.exe. If you download the .exe instead just run it and the installer will initiate
1. Download the compressed .sfx.exe in releases
2. Either double click it to extract it (creating a desktop shortcut automatically) or right click and extract with winrar anywhere you like
3. Finally, fully close Discord and execute Glasscord-Installer-for-Discord.exe or the desktop shortcut created
