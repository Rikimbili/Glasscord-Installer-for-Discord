# Description
This is a basic installer made in C++ for Powercord themes that use Glasscord. Feel free tu report any issues, I'll be on the look out to fix them.
Note: In releases you can find two versions: .sfx.exe (packaged .exe that lets you choose extraction location and auto-creates a desktop shortcut for the program) and .exe which is the standalone binaries
# Requirements
* Discord Canary (Windows only)
* Powercord

# Installation for the Installer ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
Installation steps for the .sfx.exe. If you download the .exe instead just run it and the installer will initiate
1. Download the compressed .sfx.exe in releases
2. Either double click it to extract it (creating a desktop shortcut automatically) or right click extract with winrar anywhere you like
3. Finally, execute Glasscord-Installer-for-Discord.exe or the desktop shortcut created
